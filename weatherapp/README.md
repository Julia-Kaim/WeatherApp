# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

A simple weather application built using React to exercise and improve frontend development skills. This app fetches real-time weather data for any city using an external weather API and displays key weather information in an easy-to-read interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather**: Displays current weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **City Search**: Allows users to search for the weather in any city around the world.
- **Dynamic UI**: Adjusts icons and background based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user if a city is not found or if there are API issues.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the UI.
- **Axios or Fetch**: For making API requests to fetch weather data.
- **CSS Modules / Styled Components**: To style the application (choose whichever you used).
- **Weather API**: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) or any other weather data provider.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the API key (see [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup) below).

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Key Setup

This app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data. To use it:

1. Create an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and obtain an API key.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your API key:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Restart the development server to apply the changes.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of the city in the search box and press Enter.
2. The app will display current weather information, including temperature, conditions, and other relevant data.
3. Try searching for different cities to see their real-time weather!
